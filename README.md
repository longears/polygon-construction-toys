Polygon Construction Toys
=========================

Construction toys for you to 3d print: triangles and pentagons that snap together.  Includes [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/) source files.

Also available on Thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:92243

Examples in the photos were printed on a Makerbot Replicator 2. You might need to adjust the size of the snapping nubs if you're using a different printer or material.

Inspired by these things, but incompatible with them:
